## Installation


### Prerequisites

#### Python

Before installing the package make sure you have Python version 3.10 or higher installed:

```bash
>> python --version
Python 3.10+
```

#### Poetry

The project uses the Poetry dependency manager. To install Poetry use its [official instruction](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

#### PostgreSQL / SQLite

There are two main options for using a database management system for this project: **PostgreSQL** and **SQLite**.

PostgreSQL is used as the main database management system. You have to install it first. It can be downloaded from [official website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) or installed using Homebrew:
```shell
>> brew install postgresql
```

_Alternatively you can skip this step and use **SQLite** database locally._

### Application

To use the application, you need to clone the repository to your computer. This is done using the `git clone` command. Clone the project:

```bash
>> git clone git@github.com:Orloff-Star/python-project-52.git && cd Task_manager
```

After that install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
>> make install
```

Create `.env` file in the root folder and add following variables:
```dotenv
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://{provider}://{user}:{password}@{host}:{port}/{db}
SECRET_KEY={your secret key} # Django will refuse to start if SECRET_KEY is not set
ALLOWED_HOSTS = 'webserver, localhost, 127.0.0.1:8000, 0.0.0.0'
DEBUG = True
```
_If you choose to use **SQLite** DBMS, do not add `DATABASE_URL` variable._

To create the necessary tables in the database, start the migration process:
```bash
>> make migrate
```

---

## Usage

Start the Gunicorn Web-server by running:

```shell
>> make start
```

By default, the server will be available at http://0.0.0.0:8000.

It is also possible to start it local in development mode using:

```shell
>> make dev
```

The dev server will be at http://127.0.0.1:8000.
